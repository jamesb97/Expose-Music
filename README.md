# Xpose-Music

## A React Based Music Application

This application is created using HTML, CSS, React.JS, Node.JS, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server.
Users can upload songs from local storage, search music online from our database, see what is trending, and interact with the current song playing. Below is a screenshot of the Application's Home Page, Search, and Now Playing features.
